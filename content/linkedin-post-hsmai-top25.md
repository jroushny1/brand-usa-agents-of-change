# LinkedIn Post Draft — HSMAI Top 25 Extraordinary Minds 2025

---

So here's the thing.

I have this story I tell at conferences about the time I asked ChatGPT to write my bio and it completely made up awards I'd never won. It's my go-to example for why AI hallucination matters and why you always need a source of truth.

Well. Turns out I actually won one now.

I'm honored to be named one of HSMAI's 2025 Top 25 Extraordinary Minds in Hospitality Sales, Marketing, Revenue Optimization, and Distribution. I need to update that conference talk.

But seriously — this recognition belongs to a lot of people. It belongs to the Brand USA team that said "yes" when I pitched building an AI education program for an entire industry. It belongs to every DMO professional who showed up to an Agents of Change webinar, tried the CRIT Framework on a real project, and came back to tell me what worked and what didn't. It belongs to the partners and colleagues who pushed back on my ideas and made them better.

The work I'm most proud of isn't a title or an award. It's watching destination marketers — people who a year ago had never touched an AI tool — build custom GPTs, develop AI policies for their organizations, and start asking the right questions about how this technology can serve their communities.

This industry doesn't need more AI hype. It needs practical frameworks, honest conversations about what works (and what doesn't), and people willing to learn out loud. That's what we've been building, and we're just getting started.

Grateful to HSMAI and to the incredible class of 2025 honorees. The company on this list is humbling.
